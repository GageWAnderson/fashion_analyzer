    "Rep. Adam Smith (D., Wash.) said that Harris and Democrats appeared too close to the party's progressive flank. \n",
    "\n",
    "“The extreme left is leading us into a ditch,” Smith said, citing movements to defund the police and to liberalize border policy. “The second problem, of course, is that Harris chose not to distance herself from Biden.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The political ground that Harris forfeited was expansive. Women as well as men shifted toward the Republican Party, compared with their preferences in 2020. Harris gave up a bit of her party's advantage among college-educated voters while losing substantially among voters without a four-year degree, who account for almost 60% of the electorate. Black voters doubled their support for Trump to 16%, while Latino support grew by 6 points, to 41%. Harris also lost ground among voters with less than $100,000 in household income while making gains among the smaller group of voters who earn more than that amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Michigan on the eve of the election, one vivid sign the Democrats were in trouble came at a rally thrown by vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, held at downtown Detroit's Hart Plaza. The venue can accommodate thousands of people, but the crowd filled only a fraction of the space, according to one volunteer. At one point, campaign staffers asked people to cluster in bleachers that were in view of a camera, so it would give the impression of a full crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walz and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer were among those who delivered brief remarks to a lackluster reception. The rally also featured entertainers, including REM frontman Michael Stipe and Jon Bon Jovi, who sang hits that included a 1992 release that served as a rallying cry: “Keep the Faith.”\n",
    "\n",
    "On Tuesday night, wealthy Democratic donors and operatives, who had been getting positive updates from the campaign throughout the day, watched in horror at the Conrad Hotel in Washington as election results came in. Many who had been invited to a VIP gathering at Howard University, where Harris's campaign held its election night party, decided to stay at the bar or go back to their hotel rooms to mourn alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "“'We just got our asses kicked' was the sentiment of the night,” one of the attendees said, adding that although some were starting the finger pointing, Trump's victory was so resounding that most understood it was a larger problem that went beyond Harris's campaign. “We can't nitpick.”\n",
